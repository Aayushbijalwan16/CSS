                            <h5>Method</h5>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>1. To make the syrup, gently heat the cardamom, sugar and 500ml water in a saucepan. Don't
                                    let the water boil before the sugar has dissolved. Simmer for 10 mins, then cool.</li>
                                    <li>2. Gradually add the rosewater, saffron and a little of its soaking liquid until you have a
                                    subtly flavoured syrup. Set aside.</li>
                                    <li>3. To make the gulab jamun, use a pestle and mortar to grind together the cardamom and sugar
                                    until fine.</li>
                                    <li>4. Sieve the milk powder, flour and baking powder into a mixing bowl and stir in the
                                    cardamom and sugar mixture. Rub in the 50g ghee or butter using your fingertips until the
                                    mixture resembles coarse crumbs.</li>
                                    <li>5. Add the yogurt, lemon juice and enough milk to form a soft dough, taking care not to
                                    overwork the mixture.</li>
                                    <li>6. Oil your hands with a little sunflower oil and shape small portions of the dough into
                                    walnut-sized balls, about 3cm in diameter and 20g each. Make sure the dumplings are smooth
                                    and have no cracks or folds.</li>
                                    <li>7. Reheat the syrup until it comes to the boil, then turn off the heat and cover with a lid.</li>
                                    <li>8. Heat the 1kg ghee in a wok or karahi to 130C or until a small piece of dough dropped in
                                    turns golden in 40 seconds. Fry the balls, in batches, over a medium heat for 5-7 mins,
                                    moving them around until they are an even, deep brown. Remove from the saucepan using a
                                    slotted spoon, then drain on kitchen paper. Add to the warm syrup, leaving them to soak for
                                    2-3 hrs or preferably overnight.</li>
                                    <li>9. When ready to eat, warm the gulab jamun through in a wide saucepan, spooning over the
                                    syrup. Serve piping hot with the pistachios scattered over.</li></p>

                                <li>3. Heat 2 teaspoons of the ghee or oil in pan over a medium heat, then fry the paneer chunks
                                until evenly browned on all sides. Transfer to a plate and set aside.
                                <li>4. In the same pan, heat the remaining ghee or oil, then add the cumin seeds. As soon as
                                they begin to sizzle, add the ginger and garlic and cook for 1 minute. Add the onion and
                                chillies and cook for another 7–8 minutes on a medium heat until the onions are softened.

                                puréed spinach, lower the heat and cover the pan. Cook for another 4 minutes, then add the
                                cooked paneer and cook for a further 2 minutes.

                                <ol>
                                    <li>1. 1 kg Carrots , grated (for best results, try and avoid using the core as much as
                                    possible)
                                    <li>2. 4 tablespoons Ghee
                                    <li>3. 1 liter Milk
                                    <li>4. 3/4 cup Sugar
                                    <li>5. 1 teaspoon Cardamom powder
                                    <li>6. 1/2 cup Whole Almonds (Badam) , blanched and cut lengthwise
                                    <li>7. 2 pinch Saffron strands
                                </ol>
                            </div>
                            <div><h5>Method:-</h5>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>1. To begin making the Gajjar Halwa Recipe, make sure you have all the ingredients ready
                                    and kept by the side. Grate the carrots using a hand grater or a food processor.
                                    <li>2. Heat 2 tablespoons ghee in a heavy bottomed pan; add the carrots and sauté for a few
                                    minutes until the carrots become lightly soft.
                                    <li>3. Add the milk and turn the heat to medium high and allow the milk and carrot mixture
                                    to come to a boil. Once the milk and carrot mixture come to a boil, turn the heat to
                                    medium low and cook the gajjar halwa until entire milk is evaporated.
                                    <li>4. This process will take close to 35 to 40 minutes. Make sure you keep stirring the
                                    Gajjar halwa with a wooden spoon every time the milk froths up. Stirring also prevents
                                    the halwa from sticking to the bottom of the pan.
                                    <li>5. Half way through this process, add the sugar and cook and stir until the entire milk
                                    is evaporated and until the Gajjar halwa mixture is thickened.
                                    <li>6. When you notice a halwa like consistency, add the remaining ghee, cardamom powder,
                                    saffron and the sliced almonds. Simmer for another 5 minutes and turn off the heat.
                                    <li>7. Transfer the Gajjar Halwa to a serving bowl and serve hot or cold for a delicious
                                    dessert after a meal.
                                    <li>8. You can serve the Gajjar Halwa for the cold winter nights, topped with vanilla ice
                                    cream or on its own. Serve Gajjar Ka Halwa Recipe as a dessert after your delicious
                                    festive meal of Jodhpuri Aloo Ki Sabzi, Ajwain Puri and Boondi Raita.
